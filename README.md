Translators will see:

    L10N: Here the tip for translators
    Thanks


### Update templates ###

To update POT files type:

    paver generate_locale

To automatically upload the updated POTs on Crowdin for the localization process just type:

    paver upload_translations -k [api_key]

the API Key can be retrieved in the Settings panel of the project on Crowdin. This is allowed only to the administrators.


### Retrieve PO files ###

Updated PO files can be automatically download from Crowdin typing:

    paver download_translations -k [api_key]

This is allowed only to administrators, **users can download the last version of the translations using the Crowdin web interface**.


### Compile PO files ###
